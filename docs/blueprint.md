# **App Name**: Rollup Roulette

## Core Features:

- Twitter Username Input: Input field for the user to enter their Twitter username.
- Profile Picture Display: Display the user's Twitter profile picture based on the entered username, using an external API to retrieve the image.
- Role Selection Buttons: Two interactive buttons: 'Proofer Promotion Rollup' and 'Prove Of Love Promotion Rollup'.
- Probability Calculation: Generative AI tool that determines the probability (70-90%) of getting the selected role. The tool decides at runtime how to bias toward either extreme of probability within the range, to add fun and anticipation to the results.
- Interactive Result Animation: Interactive 'egg rolling and crack out' animation sequence to reveal the probability result. Animate an egg graphic which begins rolling and then cracks open to display the result.
- Probability Result Display: Display the probability percentage alongside a celebratory visual element (e.g., confetti, sparkles).

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vivid pink (#FF69B4) to evoke fun and excitement.
- Background color: Light pink (#FCDDE9), nearly desaturated to work well with a darker scheme and the primary color.
- Accent color: Deep Purple (#6930C3) to add contrast and highlight interactive elements.
- Font: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for a geometric and contemporary feel throughout the app. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use playful icons and emojis related to egg cracking, celebrations, and roles.
- Implement smooth transitions and engaging animations for user interactions (button clicks, egg rolling).
- A clean, centered layout with a focus on visual hierarchy to guide the user's attention.
